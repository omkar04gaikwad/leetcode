## 1. Problem Analysis

- **Identify Operations:**
  - **Searching:** Need fast lookup? Use hash tables.
  - **Insertion/Deletion:** Frequent changes? Consider linked lists or trees.
  - **Ordering:** Data must be sorted? Use balanced trees or heaps.
  - **Range Queries:** Sum/min/max operations over ranges? Use segment trees or Binary Indexed Trees.
- **Assess Constraints:**
  - **Input Size:** Guides time complexity (O(1), O(log n), O(n)).
  - **Space Limitations:** Choose more space-efficient structures when needed.

## 2. Data Structures Overview

- **Arrays/Lists:**
  - *Usage:* Indexed storage and as a basis for dynamic programming (DP).
  
- **Hash Tables (Dictionaries/Sets):**
  - *Usage:* Fast lookups, frequency counts, and membership tests (average O(1) time).

- **Linked Lists:**
  - *Usage:* When you need efficient insertions/deletions and maintaining sequential order.

- **Stacks & Queues:**
  - *Usage:* LIFO (stacks) and FIFO (queues) operations, often used in tree traversals.

- **Trees (BSTs, AVL, Red-Black):**
  - *Usage:* Ordered data with efficient search, insertion, and deletion.

- **Heaps (Priority Queues):**
  - *Usage:* Quickly extract the smallest/largest element (useful in greedy algorithms).

- **Graphs (Adjacency Lists/Matrices):**
  - *Usage:* Modeling networks and connectivity; use BFS, DFS, or Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for traversal.

- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set):**
  - *Usage:* For dynamic connectivity problems and merging groups.

- **Tries:**
  - *Usage:* Fast prefix-based lookups, such as in auto-complete features.

- **Segment Trees / Binary Indexed Trees:**
  - *Usage:* Efficient dynamic range queries and updates.

## 3. Techniques and Tricks

### Two-Pointer Problems
- **When to Use:** For problems requiring evaluation of pairs or subarrays/substrings.
- **Tricks:**
  - **Sorting:** Sort the array (if unsorted) to simplify pointer movement.
  - **Initialize Two Pointers:** Typically, one at the start and one at the end.
  - **Convergence:** Adjust pointers based on current sum or condition.
- **Example:**  
  *Problem:* Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target.  
  *Approach:* Sort the array, set pointers at both ends, and move them inward based on whether the sum is too high or too low.

### Sliding Window Problems
- **When to Use:** For problems involving subarrays or substrings with a dynamic "window."
- **Tricks:**
  - **Dynamic Window Adjustment:** Expand the window to meet the condition and contract it when necessary.
  - **Hash Map for Frequency:** Track counts or indices within the window.
- **Example:**  
  *Problem:* Find the longest substring without repeating characters.  
  *Approach:* Use two pointers to maintain a window and a hash map to store the last seen positions of characters.

### Dynamic Programming (DP)
- **When to Use:** For problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
- **Tricks:**
  - **Memoization:** Cache computed results using arrays or hash maps.
  - **Clear State Definition:** Define what each state (e.g., `dp[i]`) represents.
- **Example:**  
  *Problem:* Longest Increasing Subsequence.  
  *Approach:* Define `dp[i]` as the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` and build up the solution iteratively.

### Graph Traversals
- **When to Use:** For problems modeling networks, connectivity, or pathfinding.
- **Tricks:**
  - **BFS vs. DFS:** Use BFS for shortest paths or level order traversal; use DFS for connectivity and cycle detection.
  - **Mark Visited:** Use a set or a boolean array to track visited nodes.
- **Example:**  
  *Problem:* Check if a graph is bipartite.  
  *Approach:* Use BFS to color nodes alternately and check for conflicts.

### Backtracking Problems
- **When to Use:** For exploring all possibilities (e.g., permutations, combinations).
- **Tricks:**
  - **Recursive Exploration:** Try out all possibilities and backtrack when a path doesn't lead to a valid solution.
  - **Early Pruning:** Discard paths that cannot possibly lead to a valid solution.
- **Example:**  
  *Problem:* Generate all subsets of a set.  
  *Approach:* Use recursion to include/exclude elements and backtrack accordingly.

## 4. Additional Tips

- **Start Simple:** Begin with a brute-force solution to understand the problem, then optimize.
- **Sketch Your Ideas:** Draw diagrams or write pseudocode to outline your approach.
- **Practice Regularly:** Recognize patterns by solving multiple problems.
- **Combine Data Structures:** Some challenges might require hybrid solutions (e.g., a hash map paired with a doubly linked list for an LRU cache).
