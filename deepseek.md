# Ultimate Guide to Solving Graph Problems with DFS and BFS

---

## üß† Introduction

Graph problems come in many flavors: pathfinding, cycle detection, connectivity, ordering, and optimization. Most of them boil down to using either **Depth-First Search (DFS)** or **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. This document gives you a comprehensive and crystal-clear way to identify which algorithm to use, how to structure your code, and how to modify it based on specific problem constraints.

## üî¢ Identify Graph Problem Types

Before choosing DFS or BFS, ask:

1. **What is the goal?**
 - All paths?
 - Shortest path?
 - Any valid path?
 - Topological order?
 - Use all edges once?

2. **What constraints exist?**
 - Lexicographical order?
 - Weighted/unweighted edges?
 - Can nodes/edges be reused?
 - Directed or undirected?

## üß∞ DFS: Depth-First Search

**Used when:**
- You want to explore all possibilities (backtracking).
- You want post-order behavior (e.g., process children before parent).
- You need to detect cycles.
- You want all possible paths.

### üìö DFS Recursion Template
```python
visited = set()
def dfs(node):
  visited.add(node)
  for neighbor in graph[node]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
          dfs(neighbor)
üîπ DFS with Path Tracking (All Paths)
python
Copy
path = []
result = []

def dfs(node):
  path.append(node)
  if node == TARGET:
      result.append(path[:])
  else:
      for neighbor in graph[node]:
          dfs(neighbor)
  path.pop()  # Backtrack
üîπ Iterative DFS (Stack-Based)
python
Copy
def dfs_iterative(start):
  stack = [start]
  visited = set()
  while stack:
      node = stack.pop()
      if node not in visited:
          visited.add(node)
          # Push neighbors in reverse to mimic recursion order
          for neighbor in reversed(graph[node]):
              if neighbor not in visited:
                  stack.append(neighbor)
üîπ Post-order DFS (Leetcode 332 - Reconstruct Itinerary)
python
Copy
route = []
def dfs(node):
  while graph[node]:
      next_city = heapq.heappop(graph[node])  # Lex order
      dfs(next_city)
  route.append(node)  # Post-order

# Usage:
dfs("JFK")
return route[::-1]
üîπ DFS Topological Sort
python
Copy
visited = set()
stack = []

def dfs(node):
  visited.add(node)
  for neighbor in graph[node]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
          dfs(neighbor)
  stack.append(node)  # Post-order

for node in graph:
  if node not in visited:
      dfs(node)

return stack[::-1]
üîπ Cycle Detection
Directed Graphs:

python
Copy
visiting = set()
visited = set()

def has_cycle(node):
  visiting.add(node)
  for neighbor in graph[node]:
      if neighbor in visiting:  # Back edge
          return True
      if neighbor not in visited and has_cycle(neighbor):
          return True
  visiting.remove(node)
  visited.add(node)
  return False
üåê BFS: Breadth-First Search
Used when:

You want the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

You need level-by-level traversal.

Problems with uniform edge weights.

üìö BFS Template
python
Copy
from collections import deque

def bfs(start):
  queue = deque([start])
  visited = set([start])
  
  while queue:
      node = queue.popleft()
      for neighbor in graph[node]:
          if neighbor not in visited:
              visited.add(neighbor)
              queue.append(neighbor)
üîπ BFS for Shortest Path
python
Copy
from collections import deque

queue = deque([(start, [start])])  # (node, path)
visited = set([start])

while queue:
  node, path = queue.popleft()
  if node == TARGET:
      return path
  for neighbor in graph[node]:
      if neighbor not in visited:
          visited.add(neighbor)
          queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
üîπ Multi-Source BFS (LeetCode 994 - Rotting Oranges)
python
Copy
queue = deque()
for i in range(ROWS):
  for j in range(COLS):
      if grid[i][j] == 2:  # All rotten oranges
          queue.append((i, j, 0))  # (row, col, time)

while queue:
  i, j, time = queue.popleft()
  for di, dj in directions:
      ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
      if 0 <= ni < ROWS and 0 <= nj < COLS and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
          grid[ni][nj] = 2
          queue.append((ni, nj, time + 1))
üîπ Bi-directional BFS (Optimized for Word Ladder)
python
Copy
def bidirectional_bfs(begin, end):
  if end not in word_list: return 0
  
  front = {begin}
  back = {end}
  length = 1
  word_set = set(word_list)
  
  while front:
      length += 1
      next_front = set()
      for word in front:
          for i in range(len(word)):
              for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                  new_word = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]
                  if new_word in back:
                      return length
                  if new_word in word_set:
                      next_front.add(new_word)
                      word_set.remove(new_word)
      front = next_front
      if len(front) > len(back):
          front, back = back, front  # Swap to explore smaller set
  return 0

ÔøΩ Common Pitfalls & Debugging Tips
DFS Issues:

Forgetting to backtrack (path.pop()).

Stack overflow in deep recursion (use iterative DFS).

Incorrect cycle detection in directed graphs (need visiting set).

BFS Issues:

Not marking nodes as visited when enqueuing (causes duplicates).

Using lists instead of deques for queues (slow popleft()).

Missing level tracking in shortest path problems.

General:

For weighted graphs: Never use DFS/BFS (use Dijkstra/Bellman-Ford).

Disconnected graphs: Check all nodes if visited doesn't cover everything.

üéØ Pro Tips for Interviews
"Use all tickets" ‚Üí Post-order DFS (LeetCode 332).

"Shortest path" ‚Üí BFS (unweighted) or Dijkstra (weighted).

"All paths" ‚Üí DFS with backtracking.

"Lex order smallest first" ‚Üí Use heapq in DFS.

Multi-source problems ‚Üí Initialize BFS queue with all sources.

Grid problems ‚Üí Convert grid positions to nodes (row, col).

üß© Practice Problems
Problem	Key Technique	Difficulty
797. All Paths From Source to Target	DFS + Backtracking	Medium
332. Reconstruct Itinerary	Post-order DFS + Heap	Hard
207. Course Schedule	DFS Cycle Detection / Topo Sort	Medium
200. Number of Islands	DFS/BFS Flood Fill	Medium
994. Rotting Oranges	Multi-source BFS	Medium
127. Word Ladder	Bi-directional BFS	Hard
üîÆ Final Mindset
"DFS is your scalpel for precision (backtracking, all paths), while BFS is your hammer for shortest paths and level-order. Master both, and you'll dissect any graph problem."

Remember:

Practice converting problems into graph representations.

Always dry-run with a small example to verify traversal order.

For weighted graphs, immediately think beyond DFS/BFS.
